# fs-test-task
Full-stack recruitment test task

We would like you to build a small web application for a weather dashboard. 

This repository contains an implementation of the backend part, but it contains some bugs and should be refactored. The Forecast API is built over services like Forecast.io, WeatherBug, WeatherUnderground, etc. and should allow the client to get information about the current and 7-day weather forecast from different API sources. The Cities API is built on top of the Google Places API.

The choice of font-end frameworks and libraries is up to you. Please feel free to pick technologies as you see fit. You have complete creative control over how the dashboard looks and behaves. At a minimum, please implement the following:
- The user can search for and select a city;
- The user can check the forecast for the selected city;
