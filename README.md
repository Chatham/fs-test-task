# fs-test-task
Full-stack recruitment test task

We would like you to build a small web application for a weather dashboard. 

You have an implementation of backend part, but it contains some problems and should be refactored. Weather API is built over services like Forecast.io, WeatherBug, WeatherUnderground, etc. and should allow the client to get information about current and 7-day weather forecast from different API sources. Search API for the cities is build on top of Google Places API.

The choice of frameworks or libraries for front-end part is up to you. Please feel free to pick any technologies as you see fit. You have complete creative control over how the dashboard looks and functions. The required minimum is:
- Search for the cities;
- Forecast for selected city;
